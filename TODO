   1. Email from day one: congratulations; good faith estimate of when
      the deposit is in (you have 48 hrs).
   2. 
     
   Lots of calling, email now. Who does the inputting of data? Early
   adopters: tech-savvy agents. Ten or twelve pre-loaded
   items. Perfect world: escrow officer owns the whole piece; reality:
   falls back on agents.

   Listing agent is the show-runner; behooves him to make sure that
   the seller is doing less. As a listing agent, can see what's done
   and timeline maybe once a day. How many calls or email would this
   eliminate? Back and forth every day.

   Know what's been-done, what's yet-to-be-done; six parties: buyer,
   seller, buyer-agent, seller-agent, escrow-officer, ______.

   Don't want the seller to know necessarily that buyer hasn't put the
   deposit in.

   Parties should not have all access. Only see the due dates, but not
   able to do anything. See checklist; but not checked off.

   Seller's interest: good-faith deposity within three days; did it
   come in at value; ...

   Focus on the buyer; lead-gen.

  Owning tasks; do pick the responsible owner; time being: assign to
  owner or buyer; assigned to seller, buyer can't change; but
  everybody else can change.

  Everybody can see everything; so don't add the party if you don't
  want them to have visibility.
